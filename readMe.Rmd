Basic instructions on how to generate 2 pager PDF reports based on TCdata360 data. 

# Pre-requisites:

- The R packages called in: **global_utils.R** plus **jsonlite** to process the TCdata360's API responses.
- Tex installation (To be able to knit LaTeX code into PDF)

# Setup

This is meant to be run on a local environment, for now. So download this project and change accordingly all local paths in:

- **Writer_Report_data.R**
- **Report_Generator.R**
- **datapull_TCdata360.R**

The **templates** folder contains the custom report for instance, Entrepreneurship. Ideally you don't need to change anything outside of this **templates** folder. The parameter **input_reportID** defines what report you are working with.

Tell the report what indicators and what charts you will use. For this, a configuration file is needed: **[input_reportID]_DataDescription.csv**:

- **Section**: Main topics within the report
- **Subsection**: group tag indicators. Example: Use the same name for indicators you want to appear in the same chart/table. 
- **Subsection2**: in case indicators are used in more than 1 place. In case indicators are used in 3 places, then a new column would need to be added (Subsection3), although I'm not sure this will work without further changes.
- **tcdata360_id**: TCdata360 indicator ID per the API.
- **Source_Name**: Name of data source to appear on report footnotes. Ex: WDI 
- **Source_Link**: URL pointing to data source (as hyperlink to Source_Name)
- The rest of the columns should be self explanatory

Another configuration file is needed for the overall attributes of each report. This is **[input_reportID]_ReportConfiguration.csv**

# Steps to generate PDF reports: (Once setup is complete)

1. Run **Writer_Report_data.R** to pull and store the data from TCdata360's API. Important: If you change the downloaded data file location, it is usually a good practice to keep it outside the project directory (especially if you keep versions on Github, large files will make it crash)

2. The program is prepared to ingest data from other sources as well, you will have to define it in a similar way as in **Entrepreneurship_extraData.R**

3. Run **Report_Generator.R**
